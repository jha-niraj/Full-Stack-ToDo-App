    - We need to install the node and it's libraries in our local machine, but we don't really need it all the time. So when we delete the node   modules, the package.json file keep all the exhaustive list of all the node modules that we have used in our project. And just by running the npm install command we can bring all the libraries of the node modules in our project.
